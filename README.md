# instagram

This project was created with MERN stack. A full stack copy of instagram with functionalities like register,login,create a post, following people, liking posts,comments,replies. A fun personal project to learn a little bit of both worlds, both backend and frontend.

To run it you need to open two terminals:

1. cd backend --> npm install --> npm run start:back

Then start another terminal and run:

2. cd frontend --> npm install --> npm run start:react
